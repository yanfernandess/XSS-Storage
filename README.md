# XSS-Storage
During the analysis of the website ecodotempo.com.br, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into fields that are later rendered to other users without proper sanitization, specifically on the main page of the unauthenticated (logged-out) area.
